Here are some explanations and detailed requirements for seamless API integration based on the app code:

Explanation

1. File Upload:
	•	The user uploads an XML file using the file uploader component.
	•	The app temporarily saves the uploaded XML file to the server using Python’s tempfile library. The file is then ready for API interaction.

2. Validation:
	•	The app makes a POST request to the validate-xml API endpoint.
	•	The API receives the uploaded XML file as a binary file in the request body.
	•	Based on the API response, the app displays:
	•	A success message if the XML is valid.
	•	An error message if the XML is invalid or if the validation API fails.

3. PDF Generation:
	•	If the XML file is valid, the user can click the “Generate PDF Invoice” button.
	•	The app submits the XML file to the transform-xml-to-pdf API endpoint via a POST request.
	•	Upon successful response:
	•	The API returns the generated PDF file as binary content.
	•	The app displays a download button for the user to download the generated PDF file.

4. Error Handling:
	•	The app gracefully handles exceptions during file upload, validation, or transformation.
	•	If any API call fails or encounters an error, the app displays an appropriate error message to the user.

Required Backend APIs

1. Validation API
	•	Endpoint: POST /api/validate-xml
	•	Purpose: To validate the structure and content of the uploaded XML file.
	•	Input:
	•	XML file uploaded by the user.
	•	The file is sent as part of a multipart/form-data request with the key "file".
	•	Output:
	•	Success: JSON response with the following format:

{
  "is_valid": true
}


	•	Failure: JSON response with an appropriate error message, for example:

{
  "is_valid": false,
  "error": "Invalid XML format"
}



2. Transformation API
	•	Endpoint: POST /api/transform-xml-to-pdf
	•	Purpose: To generate a PDF invoice from the validated XML file.
	•	Input:
	•	XML file uploaded by the user.
	•	The file is sent as part of a multipart/form-data request with the key "file".
	•	Output:
	•	Success: Binary content of the generated PDF file.
	•	Failure: JSON response with an appropriate error message, for example:

{
  "error": "Failed to generate PDF. Please check the XML format."
}

Integration Notes
	•	Replace placeholder API endpoints in the app (https://example.com/api/validate-xml and https://example.com/api/transform-xml-to-pdf) with the actual backend API URLs.
	•	Ensure that both endpoints handle multipart/form-data requests properly.
	•	The validation API should return a clear true/false response for "is_valid".
	•	The transformation API should return the PDF file directly as binary content, with the correct MIME type (application/pdf).

Backend API Expected Behavior
	1.	Validation API:
	•	Perform schema validation on the XML file.
	•	Respond with an accurate status (is_valid) and error details, if applicable.
	2.	Transformation API:
	•	Accept a valid XML file as input.
	•	Generate a well-formatted PDF invoice.
	•	Return the PDF as a binary file or an error if the transformation fails.
